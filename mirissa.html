				<h2>Secret Beach,Mirissa</h2>
				<div class=""><img src="sec1.jpg" width="1000" height="450"></div>
				<p>Secret beach Mirissa is despite the name suggests, not really a secret anymore…It is a small pristine secluded beach and somewhat harder to get to. 
				   Hence the name: Secret Beach
				   But it still is a beautiful V shaped beach with 2 bays on both sides to relax for a day. 
				   There isn’t much to do except some snorkeling and, of course, sunbathing. It’s not super easy or straight forward to get here, 
				   a little walk or really good motorbike skills are necessary to get to the entrance of the beach. 
				   Read in this blog post everything you need to know about Secret Beach Mirissa.</p>
